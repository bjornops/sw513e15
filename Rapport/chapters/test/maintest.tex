This chapter contains the performed testing. The testing is executed for both the individual nodes and on the entire system, to reveal problems or confirm performance of the system.

The first part of the chapter contains testing done on the nRF24L01 transceiver module used in the nodes. The second part contains testing of individual nodes, including sensors and radio modules. This leads to testing of the entire system, with multiple sensor nodes used, along with the main node.
