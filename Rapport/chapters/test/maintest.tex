This chapter contains the testing done on the individual nodes and on the whole system.

The first part of the chapter contains testing done on the nRF24L01 transceiver module used in the nodes. 

The second part contains testing of individual nodes, including sensors and radio modules. This leads to testing of the entire system, with multiple sensor nodes used, along with the main node.
