In this chapter, the project will be evaluated on different parameters. First, the working process and tools will be evaluated to clarify what methods were good, and bad. Next the final outcome of the project will be evaluated, and can also be seen as a summary of the report, which then evaluates the problem statement to the outcome. In the final section, the requirements for a fully working and implemented system will be described. Furthermore the system will be compared to other use cases, since the system might solve other problems than just soil moisture on a golf course.
