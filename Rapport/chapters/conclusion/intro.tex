In this chapter, the project will be evaluated on different parameters. First, the working process and tools will be evaluated to clarify what methods were good, and bad. The final outcome of the project will be evaluated, and is the report conclusion, which evaluates the problem statement to the outcome. In the final section, ideas for further improvements are listed. Furthermore the system will be compared to other use cases, since the system might solve other problems than measuring soil moisture on a golf course.
