\section{Future work}
For the solution to be finally implemented on a golf course, it would be required to test the solution on an actual golf course with a realistic number of nodes and some actual users. This is the only way to verify that the system actually works in a real situation, compared to the testing done in a lab.

To make the solution work on an actual golf course it would also be required to replace the radio modules because the small modules used in the project have a very limited range. This would, however, only require a hardware replace and class replace in the software because all transmitting and receiving functionality is done within the Radio class.

For the user to understand and use the collected data, it is needed to revise the presentation of the collected data. Now, the interface presents the raw data received from the node, which can confuse the user. Therefore raw data should be converted to data with a meaning, perhaps water percentage in the ground.

Statistics
 - meaning of values

Radio modules

Power usage testing

Better GUI

Cooperating with watering system or more data. Intelligent system


Use cases:

Mountains rock or snow slide

Farmer .. field moisture for watering
