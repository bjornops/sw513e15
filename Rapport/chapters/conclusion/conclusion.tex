\section{Conclusion}
The result of the project is a protocol, enabling a network of devices to transmit data wirelessly through the network to a main node. As sensor nodes are able to relay data through the network, the main node does not have to be in range of all sensor nodes to receive their data.

The analysis was based on an interview with a greenkeeper, as the project group had no prior knowledge of the problem domain. A thorough analysis was made and led to the following problem statement:
\textit{How can a sensor network and a corresponding protocol be designed for a golf course, so that data can be relayed throughout the network, enabling an endpoint device to receive the information without being within range of all sensors in the network?}
 
The problem statement then led to a requirement specification. The design phase led to a final design where technologies for the protocol were chosen. The protocol was implemented according to the design and using a customized working process.

According to the tests, a small network of nodes, can fulfill the requirements of reading sensor data, transmitting and relaying data through a network, as well as displaying the measurements in a user interface, thus successfully solving the problem statement.
