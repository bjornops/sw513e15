\section{Conclusion}
In the analysis it was found that a system, which could monitor the moisture in the soil was a solution that would optimize the amount of work required in keeping a golf course.

Furthermore it was found, that the system would be preferred as wireless, avoiding the need of digging down cables, and also the ability for the sensors to be moved freely into new areas without any restructuring.

Later in the analysis, some problem aspects were found to avoid any unseen challenges that would ruin the whole solution. Here, Power consumption, Wireless range and security, were considered. By means of that, it was chosen to let the devices communicate through each other to reduce power consumption and potentially extend wireless range.
