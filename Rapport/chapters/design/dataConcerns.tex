\section{Concerns}
Some concerns about collected data storage and power consumption for the final system is laid out through the following sections. No decisions is made during these sections, but instead presents the general ideas for the systems.

\subsection{Data concerns - We do not know version}
The final system will collect data about the golf course. The question is where this data be stored, and how will the should the data be treated?

The system are supposed to assist the greenkeepers in their daily work. The system should have an end or main node to present the data for the greenkeeper, otherwise he would have to visit each node in the system, and then he might as well do it manually. This is why the data collected from the golf course should reach an end or central node.

This also makes it unnecessary to keep long term data on the non-main nodes nodes. Each node should only have the responsibility to read data from its sensor, transmit the its data to another node, as well as forwarding data from other nodes. Treatment and storage of the data should only be handled by the end/central node. This way, each node in the system will require less processing power and will also be replaceable, except for the end/central node.



\subsection{Power concerns}

Each node in the system will require power in order to use the read data from the sensor and transmit it, but where should this power be drawn from? Power cables could be dug down together accompanying the nodes, but since the system will communicate wirelessly, that does not seem ideal. Accompanying each node with its own battery would be more fitting, since this makes the nodes independent from a power grid, and gives the greenkeepers the option of moving the nodes around the golf course.
