\section{Conciderations}
\todo{temporary title}
These subsections are had to categorize and insert at the correct place. Perhaps after "Components"

\subsection{Transfer speed}
Faster transfer speed uses more energy, but in a shorter amount of time. Slower transfer speed uses less energy, but over longer time for the nRF24L01. The slower data transfer rate has a significantly longer reach for the nRF24L01, and will therefore be implemented. 

\subsection{Pairing}
In order to add a new node to the network, the node is first needed to be paired up with the main node.
This way, a node could have assigned a unique identity to be able to recognize its sensor readings from other sensors. 
The protocol is described more indepth in \ref{cha:floodingSec}

\subsection{Overloaded nodes}
Nodes near the root transfers data for a lot of sensors. Can they handle it? Battery problems? \todo{elaborate regarding stressed nodes near the root of the tree(high throughput problems?)}

\subsection{Data importance}
The gathered data is not critical. If a packet is lost, it is negligible. If the user of the system discovers multiple missing data from a certain area or node, the node can be fixed or replaced.
