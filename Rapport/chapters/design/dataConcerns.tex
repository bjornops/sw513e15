\section{Concerns}
Some concerns about collected data storage and power consumption for the final solution is laid out through the following sections.

\subsection{Data concerns - We do not know version}
The final solution will collect data about the golf course. The question is where this data be stored, and how should the data be treated?

The solution are supposed to assist the greenkeepers in their daily work. The final solution should have an end or main node to present the data for the greenkeeper, otherwise he would have to visit each node in the network, and then he might as well do it manually. This is why the data collected from the golf course should reach an end or central node.

This also makes it unnecessary to keep long term data on the non-main nodes nodes. Each node should only have the responsibility of reading data from its sensor, transmit the its data to another node, as well as forwarding data from other nodes. Treatment and storage of the data should only be handled by the end/central node. This way, each node in the system will require less processing power and will also be replaceable, except for the end/central node.



\subsection{Power concerns}

Each node in the network will require power in order to use the read data from the sensor and transmit it, but where should this power be drawn from? Power cables could be dug down together accompanying the nodes, but since the network will communicate wirelessly, that does not seem ideal. Accompanying each node with its own battery would be more fitting, since this makes the nodes independent from a power grid, and gives the greenkeepers the option of moving the nodes around the golf course.
