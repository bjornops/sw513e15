\section{Components (?)}
Chapter \ref{cha:technologies} examined the various components viable for use in the nodes. This section contains the decisions made regarding the components.

Both Arduino Uno and Mega are used in this project, because having specifications good enough for the project and their availability to the project group. The Mega boards are not faster, but can contain more program code and allows for more components. This might not be necessary, but the devices are used as they were available.

The Raspberry Pi B+ model is used in this project as the receiver and handler of data. This device has the capability to create user interfaces and show the data received from the sensors. The B+ model is used as it was available.

\todo{Sensor her?}

The device chosen for this project is the RF24 because of the price. The shorter range is not a problem, as the project is more of a proof-of-concept. The speed is also good enough for the requirements, which makes this module good for the product described in the report.
