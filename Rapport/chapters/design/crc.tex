\section{Checksum}
Wireless communication is prone to noise and shit\todo{source}. To be able to discern correct packets from incorrect packets, a detection method is necessary. There are multiple ways to verify a packet's integrity and this section will contain description of some methods and reasoning of the selected solution.

\subsection{MD5}
Takes a lot of space. Needs to generate checksum for the received packet and compare with the received checksum.

\subsection{CRC}
Cyclic redundancy check something something..
Can be appended to the packet, resulting in a packet checksum equaling zero.

r bit CRC checksum requires degree r generator polynomial.
m bit message

M = polynomial representation of the message(binary)
R = polynomial representation of the remainder calculated by the sender
Q = quotient discarded, as only R is necessary

Sent message (transmitted data) = Mx\^r - R

Mx\^r = QG + R
