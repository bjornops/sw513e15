\section{System design}
This section contains the description of the intended system. \todo{elaborate}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The system user will use an interface to demand readings from the sensors in the network.
	\item The main node responds to the demand by sending a request packet in the network
	\item The nodes receiving the signal gathers data from its sensors and sends it back to its parent
	\item When the sent packet is acknowledged, the node retransmits the recently received request signal and awaits data.
	\item Step 3 and 4 is repeated throughout the network, so that every node within reach of the network will transmit or relay data to its parent.
	\item The main node collects all data and append each reading to the respective node in a data sheet available to the user
\end{enumerate}
