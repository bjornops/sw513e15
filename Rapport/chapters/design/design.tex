\label{cha:designintro}

This chapter contains the design choices based on the analysis, requirements and the technologies examined in Chapter \ref{cha:technologies}. The decisions made in this chapter forms the foundation of the implementation process.

First, the overall intentional system design is described. Thereafter, the components used for the sensor nodes are selected, herein platforms, sensors, and communication devices.
Then the network structure and utilized protocol chosen for the solution are described.
