\label{cha:designintro}

This chapter contains the design choices based on the analysis, requirements and the various viable technologies examined in Chapter \ref{cha:technologies}.

First, the overall intentional system design is described. Thereafter, the components used in the nodes are decided, which includes platforms, sensors, and communication devices.
Then the network and protocol chosen for the solution is described.
