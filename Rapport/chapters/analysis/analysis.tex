%During the analysis the initializing problem will be expanded by finding and specifying specific issues, Resulting in a MoSCoW analysis and a final problem statement to use during the design of a solution.

\chapter{Analysis}
To solve the broad initializing problem, narrowing down to a specific problem is needed. As the project group has little to no experience of golf course maintenance, an expert interview is needed to enlighten the subject. This will be the foundation of the analysis, as it can inform and advise to the potential tasks to embark.

Thereafter, the problem domain is analyzed, covering the physical aspects of a golf course, existing technologies, security and power consumption.

The analysis results in a final problem statement and a requirement specification. These will give sufficient grounds for the design and implementation of the solution.
