\chapter{Use case}
The purpose of this project is to create a protocol that allows multiple Arduinos to share data to a single endpoint, but a use case is needed to test the protocol.

The chosen use case for this report is soil moisture sensors for use on golf courses. A golf course is usually very large, and covering an entire golf course with cords would be a big task. Furthermore this would make the system hard to extend and almost impossible to make hot pluggable.

This makes this project a good use case for golf courses, as soil moisture is important in determining where it is necessary to water the course.
