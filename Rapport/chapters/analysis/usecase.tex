\section{Use case}
The purpose of this project is to create a protocol that allows multiple Arduinos to share data to a single endpoint, but a use case is needed to test this protocol.

The chosen use case for this report is soil moisture for use on golf courses. A golf course is usually very large, and covering an entire golf course with cords would be a big task. Furthermore this would make the system hard to extend or hot pluggable.

That makes this project a good use case for golf courses, as soil moisture is important in determining where it is necessary to water the course. Wasting water is not much of a problem in Denmark, but some places in the world, water is a sparse resource. Using less water on a large golf course could save money down the line too, and is good for the environment. The use of radiocommunication is well suited for large, open spaces, like a golf course.
