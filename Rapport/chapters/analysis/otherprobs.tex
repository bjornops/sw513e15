\subsection{Security}
In most softwaresystems it is important to evaluate the security, to avoid unauthorized access or data loss/theft. This project is not excluded from such evaluation, and in this section the greatest security issues will be considered.

The main functions of this project is to exchange data throughout a network wirelessly. Since the data is sent wirelessly, it can easily be manipulated or interfered resulting in incorrect data.

Another view is the process of connecting a new device to the network. If a device is connected too easy, it could become a problem if a neighbouring network is using the same protocol which could result in the two networks exchanging data unintentionally. Another point is that a malicious device could easily inject data into the system.

Considering the hardware design of a measuring device, it would also be relevant to analyze if a device can be physically reconstructed to intentionally transmit malicious data to the network. Though being more a question of physical security it could be an aspect in the design phase.

There could potentially be a lot of minor security issues, but the major issue in this project is that data is exchanged wirelessly and it is therefore very adaptive to malicious input. This must be taken into account in the design of a final solution.
