This section will contain descriptions of networks and network theory.

An ad-hoc wireless network is a wireless network, comprised of mobile computing devices that use wireless transmission for communication, having no fixed infrastructure \cite{murthy2004ad}. 

There are different types of network topologies, and here are some examples:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ring
	\item Line
	\item Bus
	\item Tree
	\item Star
	\item Mesh
	\item Fully connected
\end{itemize}

These can be seen in figure xx, that will be put here somewhere. The topologies considered for this use case are star, mesh, tree and ring networks. A star network has one main node that the other nodes are directly connected to. An example of a star topology network is wifi, typically with a wireless router to which other devices connect to gain network access. A tree network has a main node as well, but the devices in the network do not necessarily connect directly to the main node, but rather connect to another node that relays to the main node. This can repeat to multiple levels, so that information must be
