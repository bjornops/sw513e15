\section{Sensors}
To acquire relevant data from the golf course and to process this data in a digital domain, there has to be some sort of sensor that is capable of assessing this data, and returning a value, either digitally or with an analog signal than can be read by a microprocessor.\todo{long sentence. perhaps name ADCs? Explain what's in this section and why.}

\subsection{Moisture Sensor}
To obtain information about the moisture of the soil, a moisture sensor is needed. Simple moisture sensors are build as a pair of spikes inserted in the ground\todo{MAJOR generalization without source}. Between them a current is being sent, and the resistance of the ground is measured. Based on this value the moisture can be calculated. %INSERTNAMEHERE\todo{find navnet -.-, og find documentation, er ebays beskrivelse gyldig?} .

\subsection{Soil pH Sensor}
To get information about the acidity or alkalinity of the soil, a pH is needed. These, however, are both expensive and arguably inaccurate\todo{elaborate and source}, so they will not be covered in depth. 

\subsection {Soil Compaction Sensor}
To get information about the compaction of the ground, a sensor for measuring this can be helpful. However this is not data that changes as rapidly as moisture and pH\todo{source - and convincing?}. The slow data changes and the price point of the sensors, which at time of writing is found from 200 USD \todo{source}, results in discarding this sensor from further analysis.
