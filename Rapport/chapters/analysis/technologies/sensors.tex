\section{Sensors}
To gather relevant data from the real world, and handling this data in a digital domain, there has to be some sort of sensor that is capable of reading this data, and returning a value, either digitally or with an analog signal than can be read by a microprocessor.

\subsection{Moisture Sensor}
To obtain information about the moisture of the soil, a moisture sensor is needed. Simple moisture sensor are build as a pair of spikes inserted in the ground. Between them a current is being sent, and the resistance of the gound is checked. Based on this value the moisture can be calculated. %INSERTNAMEHERE\todo{find navnet -.-, og find documentation, er ebays beskrivelse gyldig?} .

\subsection{Soil pH Sensor}
To get information about the acidity or alkalinity of the soil, a pH is needed. These owever are both expensive and arguably unaccurate, so they will not be covered in depth. 

\subsection {Soil Compaction Sensor}
To get information about the compaction of the ground a sensor for measuring this can be helpful. However this is not data that changes as rapidly as moisture and pH. The slow datachanges and the pricepoint of sensors, which at time of writting is found from 200 usd and up, results in this sensor not being looked heavily into.
