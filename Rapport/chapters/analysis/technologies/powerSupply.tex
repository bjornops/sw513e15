\section{Power supply}

Each node in the network will require power in order to use the read data from the sensor and transmit it, but where should this power be drawn from? Power cables could be dug down together accompanying the nodes, but since the network will communicate wirelessly, that does not seem ideal.

Accompanying each node with its own battery would be more fitting, since this makes the nodes independent from a power grid, and gives the greenkeepers the option of moving the nodes around the golf course.
