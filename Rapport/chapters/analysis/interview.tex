\section{Interview}
Two interviews were performed with a greenkeeper at Aalborg Golfcourse, Kim Jensen. Kim provided insights on ideas for the system, requirements, potential problems, and additions for later iterations of the system. The interview questions and answers can be found in Appendix \ref{cha:interviewKim}. 

Kim provided the initial idea of automating the gathering of data about the golf course. He suggested soil moisture, pH value in the soil, and pressure. These are currently done manually, and could be automated to save time for the greenkeepers.

Some holes on Aalborg Golfklub is located in a swampy area, which often makes watering them obsolete. This project could help stop some of this water waste. Some holes are in a moor, where watering is often required. When it is required, this project could inform the greenkeepers, who could act on this.

Making the devices hot pluggable would be useful if there is suddenly more or less water than usually, in which case a new device can be added to this location, and the water levels can be measured to determine if there is a problem, and in that case how to solve it. The same applies if an area is more dry than usual.

An important consideration is where to place the devices. The sensors needs access to the soil in order to measure the moisture levels, but they should not be placed above ground as golfers could hit and destroy the devices. The initial idea was to place it in the holes for the sprinklers, but this is bad since sprinklers often leak, and the sensor would therefore get inaccurate readings.
This makes it necessary to bury the devices at known locations in the course. The depth the devices are buried at is important, due to the different types of grass. The greens use a layer of sand at the top, which allows water to quickly go through. This makes it necessary to place the sensor at around 10-15cm's. in the soil.

In future iterations of the project, the other sensors mentioned in the interview could be implemented to save even more work. The pH-meter would allow the greenkeepers to create specific mixes of fertilizer for different parts of the course, depending on the pH value of the soil. The pressure sensor could help determining where on the course the soil has to be pricked, in order to keep the grass growing and water flowing.
