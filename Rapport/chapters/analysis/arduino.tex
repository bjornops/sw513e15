\section{Arduino}
\label{sec:arduino}
Arduino is an open source platform, which makes the designing of an interactive or general electronics system easier. This is also why the Arduino platform is used at school for learning about electronics. It is developed by the students David Cuartielles, Gianluca Martino, Tom Igoe, David Mellis, and Massimo Banzi at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea in Italy\cite{makingofarduino}.

Arduino boards have a set op input and output ports enabling it to read from a sensor, or a button and then maybe activate a motor or an LED light. How the arduino handles or reacts to input is up to the designer which can program the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

"Arduino" covers a huge platform with a lot of different boards greatly varying in size, from Arduino Nano up to Arduino Mega. One of the more popular Arduino boards is the Arduino Uno which is somewhere in the middle of boards, considering size and power.

In the following subsections, the Uno and Mega, which will be used in this project, will be described.
