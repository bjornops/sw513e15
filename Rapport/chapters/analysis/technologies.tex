\label{cha:technologies}
There are multiple technologies available to utilize in a solution. This chapter will contain information, descriptions and examinations of the considered technologies, as well as definitions used in the report.

First, the power source for the nodes are examined, and then controller units for the sensors will be described. These are necessary to process the information from the sensors and relay information between other nodes in the system.

Second, sensor devices are studied to be able to choose an adequate unit for the solution.

Third, communication devices are examined to select an appropriate unit to use in the solution. 

In the last part of the chapter, network topologies and communication protocols are examined to explore ways to implement a network of nodes transmitting sensor data.

The chosen components, network type, and protocol can be found in Chapter \ref{cha:designintro}.
