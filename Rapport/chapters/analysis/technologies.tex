There are multiple technologies available to utilize in a solution. This chapter will contain information, descriptions and examinations of the considered technologies, as well as definitions used in the report.

Firstly, the controller units for the sensors will be described. These are necessary to process the information from the sensors and 

Secondly, sensor devices are studied to be able to choose an adequate unit for the solution.

Thirdly, network theory and topology are explained to be able to make an informed decision for the solution structure. 

Fourthly, communication devices are examined to select an appropriate unit to use in the solution. 

Lastly, analysis of communication protocols.
