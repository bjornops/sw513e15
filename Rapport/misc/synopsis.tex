The goal for this project is to design and implement a language for the Arduino, which is targeted for students and programming beginners. %The group decided to design the language language, with the goal of making it easier for beginners to program an Arduino. 
The project group had varying experience with Arduino, hence having different ideas about what features the new language should provide. These were analysed and evaluated by means of some language criteria. This analysis laid the foundation of the .Beer language.% to assemble the ideas into a complete language - .Beer.

This report describes the process from ideas and theory into the final language, over design, implementation and finally testing of the language.

The compiler has been developed using ANTLR to generate scanner and parser. The compiler is made by implementing multiple listeners and a walker to traverse the abstract syntax tree multiple times.

The .Beer language simplifies some complicated operations when working with data and pins on the Arduino. The details, that complicates these operations, are handled by the compiler.
