The goal for this project is to design, model and implement a protocol for getting sensor data to a main node. An interview with a greenkeeper at Aalborg Golfcourse led to the purpose of the implemented protocol and devices used; monitoring water moisture levels. \\
An analysis of this problem was performed, and this laid the foundation of the design of the protocol and the technology to implement it.
This report describes the process of analyzing, designing, implemenenting, and testing the protocol running on embedded systems. \\
The protocol is implemented in C++ on the devices and using radio modules for transfering data between nodes. Exponential backoff is used to make sure packets will arrive and to avoid deadlocks in the system. \\
