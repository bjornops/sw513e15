\chapter{The working process}
Since this project can be seen as the development of a professional software system, rather than personal software development, it can be considered software engineering. As the developers on this project is a group of students, it is important to set up specification and design before implementing the solution to avoid each individual in the group designing their own ideas.

In software engineering two types of software processes are usually relevant. Plan-driven and agile. In the plan-driven process all activities are planned in advance, and progress is measures against this plan. The agile process is incremental, and easier to change due to changing requirements for example.

This project is based on both processes, but separated to different areas of the developing process. As the requirements is assumed not to change during the project period, the processes of developing requirements and design will be mainly plan-driven. The requirements will be designed as prioritized, to support an agile implementation process.

An agile implementation process is chosen, because the domain of the project is new and unknown for the hole group, and therefore very hard to plan considering time. Furthermore this project has an impassable deadline, and therefore it would be hard for the group to set up a perfect set of requirements that would correspond to the project timespan.
