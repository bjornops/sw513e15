\chapter{Project introduction}
This is an introduction.


Communication technology can today be seen as a foundation for a wide range of technologies. Devices today can communicate with each other in many different ways, and can take part in large and small networks alike.
%
This report resolves around embedded systems and how communication can be established between these. This focus point is quite broad in terms where it can be applied, so this report will make use of a specific usecase to showcase the communication between embedded systems its applied usage.

The usecase that will be in focus throughout the report is the moisture of a golf course, where multiple devices will relay information about the earth's moisture levels to a central unit. If a device is placed out of range from the central unit, it will need to send the its data reading to the central unit by using other devices within reach.

To ensure that the data will reach central unit, and ensuring that the data is still correct/usable(?), a sufficient protocol must be found/established to verify this. The protocol must be able executable on the embedded devices.

% This have lead to the following initializing problem statement:



\section{Initializing problem statement}


\textit{How can a sensor network and a protocol be designed, so that data can be relayed throughout the network, enabling an endpoint device to receive the information without being within range of all sensors in the network?}
