\chapter{Introduction}
Communication technology can today be seen as a foundation for a wide range of technologies. Devices today can communicate with each other by many means, and can take part in large and small networks alike. This report revolves around embedded systems and how communication can be established between these.

The embedded system context will be linked with golf courses. As golf courses covers large areas, and the ground in the whole area contains information relevant for some people, to keep the course, an embedded system implementation could save time resources. 

To cover a large area, multiple devices would be required. Communication will be utilized by having the devices send their data to a central avoiding users to manually extract data from each device.

This is just an initiating problem domain, and because of this the first part of the report will analyse this domain to determine if any problem actually exists.


\section*{Initializing problem statement}
To initialize and give foundation for an analysis, a temporary problem statement is formulated:

\textit{Can embedded systems be utilized to assist in maintaining a golf course?}

%\section{OLD Initializing problem statement}\todo{remove this, redundant, final problem statement might be similar to this.}

%\textit{How can a sensor network and a protocol be designed, so that data can be relayed throughout the network, enabling an endpoint device to receive the information without being within range of all sensors in the network?}
