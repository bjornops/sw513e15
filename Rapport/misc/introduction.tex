\chapter{Introduction}
Communication technology can today be seen as a foundation for a wide range of technologies. Devices today can communicate with each other by many means, and can take part in large and small networks alike. This report revolves around embedded systems and how communication can be established between these.

The embedded system context will be linked with golf courses. As golf courses covers large areas, and the ground throughout the area contains information relevant for the golf course's care takers, an embedded system implementation could potentially save both time and resources. 

To cover a large area, multiple devices would be required. Communication will be utilized by having the devices send their data to a central device, avoiding users to manually extract data from each device.

This forms the initiating problem domain, and based on this the first part of the report will cover the analysis of this domain to determine and define a potential problem.


\section*{Initializing problem statement}
To initialize and give foundation for an analysis, a temporary problem statement is formulated:

\textit{Can embedded systems be utilized to assist in maintaining a golf course?}
